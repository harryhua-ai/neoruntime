# AIPC OS A/B upgrade

The OS upgrade path is intentionally separate from the existing AIPC
application/MCU firmware update.

## Runtime layout

All mutable upgrade data is stored on the persistent data partition:

```text
/data/aipc-os-upgrade/
├── incoming/<job-id>.part
├── packages/<job-id>.swu
├── jobs/<job-id>/status.json
├── jobs/<job-id>/swupdate.log
├── active-job
└── install.lock

/data/backups/aipc-os-upgrade/
├── current -> <job-id>
└── <job-id>/
    ├── manifest.json
    ├── SHA256SUMS
    ├── status
    ├── app-manifest.json
    ├── systemd.tar.gz
    ├── network.tar.gz
    └── ssh.tar.gz
```

The API streams multipart uploads to `.part`, calls `fsync`, and atomically
renames the completed package. It requires the package size plus a 2 GiB free
space reserve and at least 512 MiB available memory.

Immediately before either A/B writing or single-copy Recovery staging, the
updater creates a job-specific backup under `/data/backups`. The backup is
written to a temporary directory, checksummed, marked ready, renamed, and only
then selected through the atomic `current` symlink. A backup failure aborts the
upgrade before SWUpdate or the boot-copy selector is touched. The AIPC runtime
tree lives under the canonical `/data/aipc` root on the persistent `/data`
partition (p3), so it survives the rootfs rewrite in place and is no longer
backed up. The backup set covers the independently versioned application
units, device-specific `network`/`ssh`, and the `app-manifest`; `/usr/bin` and `/usr/libexec`
symlinks (which live on the rewritten rootfs) are rebuilt deterministically by
`aipc-restore` from `/data/aipc/bin` and `/data/aipc/libexec`. The boot control
units, sysctl, journald and loader configuration always come from the new OS
image.

## Services

- `aipc-os-updater.service` writes only the inactive A/B copy. A failed
  `swupdate` never changes the selected boot copy.
- `aipc-os-reboot.service` records the rebooting state before reboot.
- `aipc-os-verify.service` checks the selected copy, OS version,
  `platform-api`, `camera-daemon`, and persistent data for 60 seconds. A
  failure selects the previous copy and reboots.
- `aipc-restore.service` is embedded in the OS and runs before
  `network-pre.target`. It verifies `SHA256SUMS`, restores network/SSH first,
  then rebuilds executable links while preserving OS-owned definitions.
- `aipc-firstboot.service` runs after restore. Its OS-owned entry point
  `/usr/libexec/aipc-firstboot` execs the full runtime script from the
  canonical `/data/aipc/scripts/aipc-firstboot.sh` root, with a minimal-init
  fallback when `/data/aipc` is empty on a fresh rootfs.

The bootloader must also enforce a finite boot-attempt counter. Userspace
verification cannot recover a target image that never reaches systemd.

## Production configuration

The following environment variables may be set on `platform-api.service`:

```text
AIPC_OS_UPGRADE_DIR=/data/aipc-os-upgrade
AIPC_OS_MACHINE=hailo15-ne503
AIPC_OS_PRODUCT=ne503
AIPC_OS_HARDWARE_VERSION=1.0
AIPC_OS_REQUIRE_SIGNATURE=true
AIPC_OS_REQUIRE_BUILD_TIME=true
AIPC_OS_ALLOW_DOWNGRADE=false
AIPC_COPY_A_VALUE=a
AIPC_COPY_B_VALUE=b
AIPC_FILESYSTEM_DEVICE=mmcblk1
AIPC_RECOVERY_DIR=/data/aipc/recovery
AIPC_BACKUP_ROOT=/data/backups/aipc-os-upgrade
```

The shipped `platform-api.service` enables signature and build-time checks and
pins machine/product/hardware metadata. Signature validation requires both a
`sw-description.sig` entry and a successful SWUpdate cryptographic package
check before a job becomes ready. Development images may explicitly override
these environment values, but production must remain fail-closed.

The verifier accepts:

```text
AIPC_PERSISTENT_DATA=/data/aipc-data
AIPC_DATABASE_PROBE=/data/aipc-data/platform.db
```

## Image requirement

The new rootfs must contain the `aipc-bootstrap` package from
`meta-hailo-camthink`. This package provides:

```text
/usr/libexec/aipc-restore
/usr/libexec/aipc-firstboot
/lib/systemd/system/aipc-restore.service
/lib/systemd/system/aipc-firstboot.service
/lib/systemd/system/<aipc-service>.service
/etc/systemd/system.conf.d/<aipc-manager-drop-in>.conf
/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/<aipc-journal-drop-in>.conf
/etc/sysctl.d/99-aipc-watchdog.conf
/etc/ld.so.conf.d/aipc.conf
/etc/aipc-os-release
```

`packagegroup-camthink-aipc-system` depends on `aipc-bootstrap`, so the normal
NE503 image receives these files automatically. The AIPC release tree (binaries,
libraries, configs, models, applications) lives under the canonical `/data/aipc`
root on persistent `/data`, so it survives the rootfs rewrite in place; only
`/usr/bin` and `/usr/libexec` symlinks are rebuilt by `aipc-restore`. The backup
under `/data/backups` carries application units, network, SSH, and the app
manifest.

Boot ordering is:

```text
mount /data
  -> verify and restore network + SSH + AIPC
  -> start network
  -> run full aipc-firstboot.sh
  -> start event-bus/camera/AI/API/app services
  -> run OS upgrade verification
```

## Required A/B partition layout

Dual-copy online OS upgrade uses:

```text
/dev/mmcblk1p1  copy A boot
/dev/mmcblk1p2  copy A rootfs
/dev/mmcblk1p3  copy B boot
/dev/mmcblk1p4  copy B rootfs
/dev/mmcblk1p5  persistent data
```

Run the read-only check on a device:

```bash
/data/aipc/scripts/aipc-os-layout-check.sh
```

Legacy devices with `p1=boot`, `p2=rootfs`, `p3=data` use
`single-recovery` mode. The updater validates the AIPC bundled Recovery,
backs up the existing files from `p1`, atomically stages the bundled
`fitImage` and recovery rootfs, stores
`swupdate_update_filename=local:/aipc-os-upgrade/packages/<job>.swu`, selects
Hailo's `remote_update` boot image, and waits for explicit reboot. Recovery
mounts `p3`, writes `stable,copy-a`, then returns to copy A.

The uploaded SWU no longer needs to contain a modified Recovery. Standard old
and new SWU packages are accepted as upgrade content. Recovery execution is
provided independently by:

```text
/data/aipc/recovery/
├── manifest.json
├── fitImage
└── swupdate-image-hailo15-ne503.ext4.gz
```

The manifest binds the machine, protocol, recovery version, BSP version,
optional secure-boot key ID, artifact sizes and SHA-256 values. The bundled
rootfs itself must contain `AIPC_LOCAL_RECOVERY_V1`.

Both validation and installation repeat the layout check. A boot-copy/root
mount mismatch or a mounted inactive A/B partition stops the job before any
rootfs write.

### Optional migration to A/B

Legacy devices can continue using recovery upgrades. To gain inactive-copy
writes and rollback, they must be migrated to A/B. They cannot be converted
while running from `p2`, because creating the dual GPT deletes and recreates
the partition table and moves data to `p5`.

Use this offline recovery procedure:

1. Back up all required content from `/data` (legacy `p3`) to another host.
2. Publish the matching `fitImage`, SWUpdate init image, and
   `hailo-update-image-hailo15-ne503.swu` to the recovery/TFTP server.
3. Boot to the U-Boot menu and select **eMMC AB Board Init**. The configured
   update modes are `init-partitions-dual,init-scu-bl,copy-a`.
4. Boot copy A and verify that `p1` through `p5` exist.
5. Restore persistent content to `/data` (`p5`).
6. Run `aipc-os-layout-check.sh`, then test A→B and B→A upgrades.

Do not run `init-partitions-dual` from the installed rootfs.

## Preparing the bundled Recovery

`pack-release` and `pack-factory` invoke:

```bash
scripts/prepare_recovery_bundle.sh \
  --swu <Yocto SWU containing the AIPC recovery init> \
  --dest build/recovery/hailo15-ne503 \
  --machine hailo15-ne503 \
  --bsp-version 1.11.0 \
  --recovery-version 1.0.0
```

Override packaging inputs when required:

```bash
make pack-release \
  RECOVERY_SWU=/path/to/hailo-update-image-hailo15-ne503.swu \
  RECOVERY_VERSION=1.0.0 \
  RECOVERY_BSP_VERSION=1.11.0 \
  RECOVERY_KEY_ID=production-2026
```

Packaging fails if the Recovery image does not contain the local update
protocol marker.

## Device validation

Before production enablement, test:

1. Corrupt CPIO, rootfs gzip, SHA-256, signature, machine and hardware data.
2. Insufficient disk/memory and concurrent requests.
3. Browser disconnect and `platform-api` restart during installation.
4. Power interruption at each SWUpdate phase.
5. A→B, B→A, successful verification, userspace rollback and bootloader
   boot-attempt rollback.
