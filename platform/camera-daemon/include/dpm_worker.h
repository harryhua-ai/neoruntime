/**
 * @file dpm_worker.h
 * @brief Dynamic Privacy Mask (DPM) worker — detection + semantic segmentation.
 *
 * DECOUPLED from the static privacy-mask blender. Runs one or more inference
 * sessions on a dedicated thread and publishes a per-frame **bytemask** — a
 * single frame-resolution silhouette mask aggregating every selected target:
 *   - person    -> linknet semantic segmentation -> real per-pixel silhouette
 *   - vehicle / face / license_plate -> detection bbox -> filled rect OR'd in
 * (no segmentation model exists for the latter three; a tight box is acceptable.)
 *
 * The pre-encoder frontend lambda (camera_daemon.cpp) consumes get_latest() and
 * bakes the bytemask onto the live encoder-input frame via HAL_DRAW_OPS — a pure
 * pixel-bake with its OWN style (mosaic/blur/overlay + dpm_color), completely
 * independent of the static medialib blender which keeps owning the static
 * polygons + the static color. Toggling one never disturbs the other; the two
 * never share state.
 *
 * ## Clean-capture input model (fix: inference no longer feeds on masked frames)
 *
 * The bake happens IN-PLACE on the shared DMA-BUF encoder-input frame, on the
 * GStreamer streaming thread, BEFORE FrameRouter routes it to subscribers. So a
 * normal downstream subscriber would always see an ALREADY-MASKED frame → the
 * mask would feed back into its own detection (the person it just hid). To break
 * that feedback loop the worker is NOT a FrameRouter subscriber. Instead the
 * frontend lambda calls offer_frame() SYNCHRONOUSLY on the streaming thread,
 * BEFORE the bake, while the frame is still clean. offer_frame() DSP-resizes
 * the clean frame into each model's ping-pong input buffer (the exact 4K→model
 * resize the inference already did — now relocated pre-bake), then signals the
 * worker. The worker runs inference on the buffered clean input and publishes.
 * This is the "Clean Frame Path" layer of the 3-layer design: inference + mask
 * state run only on clean data; the bake is purely a per-stream render stage.
 *
 * Concurrency (2-buffer ping-pong, drop-on-pending — race-free):
 *   - offer_frame (streaming thread): lock offer_mu_; if a capture is still
 *     pending (offer_seq_ != taken_seq_) the worker hasn't consumed the last
 *     capture yet → DROP (return), keeping no in-flight buffer for the streaming
 *     thread. Otherwise resize frame→session.input_fb[session.write_idx] for
 *     every session, flip each write_idx, ++offer_seq_, notify.
 *   - worker_loop (DPM thread): wait until offer_seq_ != taken_seq_ || !running;
 *     under offer_mu_ take each session's read_idx = write_idx^1 (the just-written
 *     buffer), set taken_seq_ = offer_seq_, unlock; run inference on those buffers.
 *   - Invariant: while the worker holds read_idx across inference, the next write
 *     goes to write_idx (= read_idx^1) — a DIFFERENT buffer — and further writes
 *     drop until the worker takes again. So no buffer is ever written while read.
 *
 * Architecture (see /root/.claude/plans/jiggly-napping-pretzel.md):
 *   streaming thread --offer_frame(clean frame)--> resize into ping-pong model
 *                                                            input buffers
 *                                                            (drop-on-pending)
 *     worker thread: wait -> take buffers -> for each active spec:
 *       tensor_from_frame -> run -> postproc
 *       is_seg  -> threshold linknet mask (cid==1||cid>=128) -> upscale -> OR into bytemask
 *       !is_seg -> keep_labels filter -> fill bbox rects -> OR into bytemask
 *     -> merge occupied bytemask into mosaic_cells (run-length merge, no coverage gap)
 *     -> DpmMaskState{mask, mosaic_cells} (mutex-protected shared_ptr)
 *   Frontend lambda: get_latest() -> overlay=one draw_mask(mask);
 *                    mosaic/blur=iterate mosaic_cells (camera_daemon.cpp)
 *
 * Inference NEVER runs on the streaming/frontend thread (would stall it). The
 * streaming thread does only the proven 4K→model DSP resize (relocated from the
 * worker); the frontend lambda does only an O(1) shared_ptr load + a single
 * draw_mask or bounded draw_mosaic calls. Upscaling the seg mask to frame
 * resolution happens on the worker thread, never the hot path.
 *
 * Reference: hal_v2/examples/ai_example_v2/ai_example_v2.cpp — stage1 detection
 * AND the linknet segmentation render path (cid==1||cid>=128 threshold), both
 * re-expressed via HAL_INFERENCE_OPS + HAL_POSTPROCESS_OPS + HAL_DSP_OPS +
 * HAL_FRAME_BUFFER_OPS.
