// Package gyro provides real-time device attitude (orientation) data sourced
// from the on-board LSM6DSR IMU via the Linux IIO sysfs interface.
//
// The package fuses accelerometer + gyroscope samples with a complementary
// filter into a normalized orientation quaternion expressed in the Z-up world
// frame expected by the web console (X forward, Y right, Z up).
//
// A Source is the pluggable data contract consumed by the SSE handler. The
// default implementation is IIOSource (sysfs reader); future implementations
// may source data from device-control gRPC or the event bus without changing
// the handler.
